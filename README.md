# LaTeX template for reviewer replies

This is a simple LaTeX template used for replying to reviewer comments. It 
supports cross-referencing points raised by reviewers and includes the 
following commands:

* ``\point``: mark a point raised by a reviewer that needs addressing
* ``\needsreply``: mark a point that needs a reply (used during writing)
* ``\reply{...}``: create a reply box to reply to a point
* ``\partialreply{...}``: highlight a reply as being work in progress (used 
  during writing)
* ``\todoreply{...}``: unfinished reply

See the ``review_reply.tex`` file for usage instructions.
